## No longer running in Serenity and because I can't migrate to Dawn or Discord-rs for concerns about stability and likelihood of these libraries being maintained in the long term, I'll be returning the bot to Discord.py. 
# What is your current plan?
Current plan is to prototype and push features quickly to gauge how good they actually are in implementation then revisit rust or other fast language's libraries for Discord. Preferably this would have been Dawn, but if Serenity is going strong in early 2020 I'll probably end up using that. You can see the features that I have planned so far in the "Projects" section of this repository.
# What is wrong with Serenity?
Nothing.
# What about Dawn and Discord-rs
Abandoned libaries.
# Will I be able to run this bot on my hardware using my own Token?
You will be able to for the most part, but it's not going to be something I particularly accomodate for so if something doesn't work because I've hardcoded something to interact with me or a particular server then I invite you to fork the repository and change it as you see fit. But being real and all, you may as well just write your own bot than propogate my terrible code.
