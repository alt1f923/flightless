# Discord bot written in Twilight-rs
Dawn has been given renewed life and is now operating under the name 'Twilight'.  
Because of this I will be migrating my bot back to Rust.
### Can I be able to run this bot on my hardware using my own Token?
Yes. To an extent, you will be able to run Flightless on your own Token, even provide your own custom command prefix from the command terminal when you start it.

# Installation
### WIP
# Usage
### Start bot
`./Flightless {token} {mongodb uri}`  
**I heavily recommend making a shell/bash/etc file to start Flightless from.**
